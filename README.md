The use of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) devices is needed to obtain a high efficiency of a PV system. A significant issue in CPV technology is a non-uniform illumination that is produced onto a PV cell. Non-Uniform illumination decreases the effectiveness of a PV cell. This Project provides an insight into the design CPV systems which reflects uniform-illumination onto a PV cell receiver, to obtain higher efficiency and a longer lifespan of a PV cell. In this paper, the reflection profile y(x) is designed, which obtains a uniform illumination. A two-dimensional cone concentrator which concentrates sunlight non-uniformly was studied and simulated to determine the efficiency. The most effective cone angle was established also the effect the reflection coefficient has on the system was analysed.
